# Buzzing Men : Turbo Title Jam

Silly little ECS test w/ the title of 'Buzzing Men'!

Honestly, a lot of the work in here is just work for an ecs bit w/ Turbo, so having a variety of entities running simultaneously was pretty rad!

Also, for the life of me idk what happened, but text broke??? So get my handwriting w/ mouse for now for visual text :3333

## Note of Code Usage

If you want to use anything here, feel free too! If possible just ping @i_got_boredddd on discord as I'd like to see what people do with the draft of the system!

Over the course of the summer, I'mm be working on the ecs, so keep ya eyes peeled!
